        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>Embark on an emotional first-person narrative adventure where you control
            the story—and affect its outcomes—with your real-life blinks. With this
            innovative technique you will immerse yourself in a world of memories as your
            whole life flashes before your eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Game Tips</h3>
        <p>1. Use the blinking feature, not click to blink!!!
        <br> &emsp;- I genuinely cannot stress this one enough, clicking it works, but it literally takes away all the emotion, using blinking teaches you that you can't
            &emsp; hold onto every moment in your life, and that it passes. <br><br>
            2. Steam is the best place to purchase this game <br>
            &emsp;- I first purchased Before Your Eyes on GOG Galaxy, but after trying to calibrate the blinking, it wouldn't work (due to their missing license for &emsp;
            Mac), I then got it refunded and purchased it from Steam, which fixed the problem. Steam should be your first choice!
            <br><br>
            3. Go into Before Your Eyes blind!<br>
            &emsp; - The game is short, if you get something spoiled for you, that's on you, so don't read anything about it other than maybe a short description. &emsp; The game is meant to captivate you on the first play, remember that!
            <br><br>
            4. Pay attention to the story <br>
            &emsp; - The tone, atmosphere, and mood of the game sets your whole experience, if you engage enough, you will be rewarded, trust me. I personally <br>&emsp; didn't pay enough attention, and I kinda regret that.
            <br><br>
            5. Play in the right setting <br>
            &emsp; - You can't play in a super dark room, since you need proper lighting to calibrate your blinks, so I suggest a moderately lit room at night, or a <br> &emsp; light next to you to make sure your face is visible for the camera and turn off the room lights. This gives proper emotion for the game.
            <br><br>
            6. Don't hold back blinking <br>
            &emsp; - Using your blinks to move the story forward teaches you that you can't hold onto every moment of life, so respect that about the game.
        </p>

        <h3>What I love about Before Your Eyes</h3>
        <p>The choices you make in this game has impact, you probably won't notice it in the first play, but the game
        has multiple choices for you to make, that alter the story in a subtle way.
        <br><br>
        The game is also super emotional, the tone in the game is set to make you cry, don't try to hold that back, I personally
        didn't cry while playing the game, likely due to me not paying enough attention to the story.</p>

        Last, the story explores the life of the protagonist using blinking, a super creative game choice, you move through their life using blinking which is super cool if you try it.

        <h3>Parents' Guide</h3>
        <p>Before Your Eyes explores the theme of death, illness, and the afterlife. The game is emotional and I believe it would be a
            little too confronting for anybody under the age of 13. Blood is also shown in this game (cartoon blood, not real, of course), anyone sensitive to blood, I would advise against playing, though it is fairly mild and not human blood.</p>
