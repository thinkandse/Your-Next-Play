        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>Firewatch is a mystery set in the Wyoming wilderness, where your only emotional lifeline is the
            person on the other end of a handheld radio.
        The year is 1989.
<br><br>
You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a mountain, it's your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.
<br><br>
An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a woman named Delilah, is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio—and is your only contact with the world you've left behind.
<br><br>
But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the world below, you'll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making interpersonal choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Game Tips</h3>
        <p>1. Play in one sitting (or at least end at a reasonable time)<br>
        &emsp; - It'll take about 4-6 hours to finish the game, plan out a block of time that is 4-6 hours long, and play (take a little break if you want to).
            <br> &emsp; However, if you cannot find 4-6 hours, end your session before the important bits of the game, which means you can plan for about 2-3 hours
            <br> &emsp; before replaying it on a different day.</p>

        2. Play at a reasonable time<br>
        &emsp; - By reasonable, I mean good time, if you plan to play in one sitting, I recommend playing the game starting at around 3-4 o'clock in the
        <br> &emsp; afternoon (it really depends on the season and where you live), so when the sun sets, and it turns dark, you'll experience the emotional and  <br> &emsp; exciting parts of the game, it'll also feel as if the
        time is moving with you, very immersive!
        <br><br>
        3. Let the dialogue naturally come to you <br>
        &emsp; - Don't think too much about which dialogue to pick, it won't affect the story, only the response and sometimes the names of things.

        <h3>What I love about Firewatch</h3>
        <p>The slow burn and character development is amazing, I simply cannot forget how magical the experience with Delilah as Henry was. Of course, the ending wasn't tied up with a neat little bow, but that's okay. The world building also looked beautiful, a very cinematic depiction of a Wyoming forest.
        The action in the middle of the story got me on my toes for a bit, loved it. Also can't forget to mention the funny, witty, and at times, emotional conversation and dialogue with Delilah.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Parents' Guide</h3>
        <p>There are many times where crude language and sexual jokes were made. Death is part of the game, but not as confronting as other games like Edith Finch or even Before Your Eyes. I would recommend to anyone 14+.</p>
